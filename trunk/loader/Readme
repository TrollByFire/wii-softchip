1.) What is SoftChip?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoftChip was originally a piece of homebrew software designed to allow you to
play your 1:1 backup games on your Nintendo Wii.  However, it is quickly
evolving into an entire platform designed to ease the process of running any
kind of Wii application, official or homebrew, through several different parts
of the SoftChip Platform.

2.) Why do I need this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a hardware-based modchip, you don't. Yet.  This was originally 
designed for those who don't necessarily have the technical abilites or money to
have one installed in their wii.  

3.) What about piracy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
We DO NOT condone piracy and will not answer any questions for suspected pirates.
That being said, this will be one of those controversial softwares that allow
the pirates to do "their thing."  Hopefully this will discourage it a small bit.

It's possible to load an application onto a fakesigned wii disc that could be
harmful or even brick your wii. Happy now?  Good.  The bottom line is this:

********************************************************************************
          *** If you didn't dump your copies, don't run them. ***
********************************************************************************
 
Game Developers get paid when the software they've written sells.  If they
don't get paid, they don't write any more games.
 
The pirates are ruining it for everybody.
 
4.) How do I install / run this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As early as it is in the development cycle, the official answer is this:
 
If you don't already know HOW to run this, you probably shouldn't be running
it.  Wait for a non-alpha or non-beta release.
 
5.) Is this software safe?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As safe as a program designed to load and run another program can be.  Meaning
it's only safe as the software you load with it is.
