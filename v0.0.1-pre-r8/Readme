1.) What is SoftChip?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SoftChip is a piece of homebrew software designed to allow you to play your 1:1
backup games on your Nintendo Wii.

2.) Why do I need this?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you have a hardware-based modchip, you don't.  This is designed for those who
don't necessarily have the technical abilites or money to have one installed in
their wii.

3.) What about piracy?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I DO NOT condone piracy and will not answer any questions for suspected pirates.
That being said, this will be one of those controversial softwares that allow
the pirates to do "their thing."  Hopefully this will discourage it a small bit.

Know this: It's technically possible to load an application onto a "fake" wii
disc that will overwrite your NAND, and brick your wii.  Happy now?  Good.  The
bottom line is - If you didn't dump your copies, don't run them.
 
Game Developers get paid when the software they've written sells.  If they
don't get paid, they don't write any more games.
 
The pirates are ruining it for everybody.
 
4.) How do I install / run this?
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As early as it is in the development cycle, the official answer is this:
 
If you don't already know HOW to run this, you shouldn't be running it.  Wait
for a non-alpha or non-beta release.
 
5.) Is this software safe?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As safe as a program designed to load and run another program can be.  Meaning
it's only safe as the software you load with it is.
